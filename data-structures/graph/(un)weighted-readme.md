## Weighted & Unweighted Graphs 
- Weighted Graph:
  - Representation: `A--4--B`
  - Can be distance, 
  - Used to calculate shortest distance between nodes
- Unweighted Graph:
  - Representation: `A-----B`
  - All connections treated as equal
  - Unweighted Graph is a Weighted Graph whith unit 1; `A--1--B`
