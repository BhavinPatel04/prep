#### Graph
- Graph is a data structure used to store data just like all data
  structures
- Graph can be defined as an ordered pair of set `v` of vertices   (node) and set of edges (link) `e`
  `G = (v, e)`
  - Ordered Pair:
    - Representation: `(u, v)`
    - Order matters
    - `(u, v) != (v, u) if(u != v)`
  - Unordered Pair:
    - Representation: `{u, v}`
    - Order does not matter
    - `{u, v} == {y, u}`
  - Directed Edge:
    - Representation: `u----->v`
    - Used in Ordered Pair `(u, v)`
  - Undirected Edge:
    - Representation: `u------v`
    - Used in Unordered Pair `{u, v}`
